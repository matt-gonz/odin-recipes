        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is a meal that I thoroughly enjoy while on my "bulking" phase
            of my fitness journey. It is rather simple to put together, and the 
            macros are great.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 oz. chicken breast tenderloins</li>
            <li>1 cup extra long grain rice, leftovers preferred</li>
            <li>2 tbsp avocado oil</li>
            <li>2/3 cup frozen mixed vegetables</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 onion, diced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat 1 tbsp oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and 
                garlic until slightly brown, then add in your chicken breasts. 
                Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir-fry for 5 to 6 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once chicken is finished cooking, remove from heat and set aside in 
                separate bowl/container. Heat 1 tbsp oil in large skillet over medium 
                heat. Stir in frozen vegetables and saute for about 2 minutes, or 
                until thawed. Once thawed, add rice. Pour in soy sauce and mix thoroughly.
            </li>

                Finally, stir in scrambled eggs. Once eggs are about 80% cooked, mix in
                the cooked chicken that was set aside earlier. Serve hot and enjoy!
