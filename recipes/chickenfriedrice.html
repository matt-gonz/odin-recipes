        <p>
            This is a meal that I thoroughly enjoy while on my "bulking" phase
            of my fitness journey. It is rather simple to put together, and the 
            macros are great.

        <h3 class="subheading">Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <ul class="myUL">
                <li>10 oz. chicken breast tenderloins</li>
                <li>1 cup extra long grain rice, leftovers preferred</li>
                <li>2 tbsp avocado oil</li>
                <li>2/3 cup frozen mixed vegetables</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>1/4 onion, diced</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="subheading">Steps</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <ol class="myOL">
                <li>
                    Heat 1 tbsp oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and 
                    garlic until slightly brown, then add in your chicken breasts. 
                    Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir-fry for 5 to 6 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once chicken is finished cooking, remove from heat and set aside in 
                    separate bowl/container. Heat 1 tbsp oil in large skillet over medium 
                    heat. Stir in frozen vegetables and saute for about 2 minutes, or 
                    until thawed. Once thawed, add rice. Pour in soy sauce and mix thoroughly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, stir in scrambled eggs. Once eggs are about 80% cooked, mix in
                    the cooked chicken that was set aside earlier. Serve hot and enjoy!
